# ADR-0006 — Polyglot Persistence and Data-Store Security

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-10-09

## Context

[ADR-0002](ADR-0002-composition-supplied-persistence-and-capability-owned-schemas.md) settles relational persistence: the host supplies a PostgreSQL connection, and each capability owns its schema and migrations. Some capabilities will be better served by other kinds of store: a graph database for relationship-heavy domains, a search index, an object store for files, a cache, or a time-series store for metrics. ADR-0002 does not say whether these are allowed, who owns them, or how authorisation and tenant isolation reach data that never passes through PostgreSQL.

Two risks follow if this is left open. A capability may adopt a store whose own access model (for example a search index queried directly from the browser, or a vector store with no tenant filter) bypasses the server-side authorisation the platform requires. And data copied into a secondary store may escape revocation, erasure and data-region rules that its owner applies to the primary copy.

## Decision

1. **Other stores are allowed, behind ports.** A capability MAY use a non-relational store when its access pattern justifies one. It declares a port for it, as ADR-0002 requires for PostgreSQL; the host supplies the client. ADR-0002's rules on ownership, failing closed, provider SDKs and credentials apply unchanged to every kind of store.
2. **One owner, one system of record.** Each piece of data has exactly one owning capability and one authoritative store. Other stores hold derived copies (projections, indexes, caches) that the owner can rebuild and must keep consistent with revocation and erasure.
3. **Authorisation is decided before the store is queried.** No store is queried directly from the browser, and no store's built-in access model replaces server-side authorisation. A capability querying a store that cannot evaluate the platform's policy narrows the query with the caller's **visible scopes**: the set of groups and tenant whose information the caller may read, obtained from Authorisation's scopes query for that permission. Results are still checked per item where the permission requires it.
4. **Tenant isolation is enforced in every store.** Every stored record or document carries its tenant identifier and owning group identifier. Every query is filtered by tenant, with the filter applied by the capability's data-access code, never by the caller.
5. **Defence in depth on PostgreSQL.** Where a capability holds tenant- or group-isolated rows, it SHOULD enable row-level security, set the request's tenant and scopes with `SET LOCAL` inside the transaction, and connect with a role that is not the table owner and cannot bypass row-level security.
6. **Personal data stays where Profile puts it.** Under [ADR-0005](ADR-0005-iam-suite.md), stores outside Profile hold opaque identifiers, never personal data, unless a capability's documented purpose requires it and its erasure procedure covers every store it uses.
7. **Data region follows the tenant.** A tenant's data region, once set, applies to every store holding that tenant's data, including derived copies and backups.

The concrete controls are in the [Data Store Security Standard v0.1](../standards/data-store-security-v01.md).

## Consequences

### Positive

- Capabilities can choose the store that suits them without weakening authorisation, isolation or privacy.
- Revocation, erasure and data-region rules have one owner for each piece of data.
- Authorisation stays the single source of access decisions, including for stores that cannot run its policy.

### Costs

- Authorisation must provide a scopes query, and hosts must make it available to capabilities that use non-relational stores.
- Each derived copy needs a rebuild and erasure path, with tests.
- Hosts operate more kinds of infrastructure, each needing credentials, TLS, backups and monitoring.

## Guardrails

- A capability that adds a store documents it in its composition contract and threat model, with the store's port, what it holds, its system of record and its erasure path.
- Isolation tests (Security Architecture §6) cover every store a capability uses, not only PostgreSQL.
- Changes to these rules require a new ADR.
